# leaflet-challenge
In this assignment challenge, I used geographic visualisation techniques to map GeoJSON data on earthquakes and tectonic plates. JavaScript libraries, including Leaflet and D3, were utilized to plot the data. The geographic visualizations are divided into two parts.

Part 1: Creating the Earthquake Visualization
This section visualises earthquake data from the past seven days by connecting to the GeoJSON API from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Using Leaflet, spatial plots are generated from the earthquake API dataset based on their longitude and latitude. The data markers on the map represent the earthquake's magnitude through the size of the circles at the earthquake locations and the depth through color. Darker colors indicate greater depth, while lighter colors indicate shallower depths. Clicking on an earthquake marker reveals details about the earthquake, including its magnitude, depth, and location.
